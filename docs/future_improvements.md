- **Effort**: 4-6 hours | **Risk**: Low

### Request Timing & Progress
Status: Completed (core)
**Goal**: Transparent request timing and progress (excluding display update)
- **Per-request timing**: Measure request duration with a monotonic clock; exclude e‚Äëink display update time from metrics
- **Progress bar**: Steps shown in UI ‚Äì Preparing ‚Üí Sending ‚Üí Waiting (device) ‚Üí Display updating (excluded) ‚Üí Done
- **Timing display**: Show elapsed time/badge on recent actions/history
- **Logging**: Record durations for later review
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Risk**: Low

### Subtle Polish Enhancements
**Goal**: Professional look without breaking existing functionality
- **Loading states**: Replace basic spinners with skeleton loading for plugin cards
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth transitions for state changes (gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- **Visual feedback**: Better hover states, focus indicators
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizing, improved readability
- **Status indicators**: Clear visual states for plugin health/errors
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours | **Risk**: Low

## ‚ö° Performance & Reliability

### Smart Caching (Conservative)
**Goal**: Faster page loads without breaking existing functionality
- **Static asset caching**: Proper cache headers for CSS/JS/images
- **Plugin output caching**: Cache successful plugin renders (with TTL)
- **Image optimization**: Compress uploaded images automatically
- **Browser caching**: Leverage browser cache for static assets
- **Effort**: 3-5 hours | **Risk**: Medium (test thoroughly)

### Background Process Reliability
**Goal**: More robust plugin execution
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry for failed plugin updates
- **Timeout handling**: Graceful handling of slow/hung plugins
- **Memory management**: Basic cleanup for long-running processes
- **Health checks**: Simple status indicators for plugin health
- **Request timing metrics**: Capture per-request durations (excluding display update) and surface in UI/logs
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours | **Risk**: Medium

## üíæ Backup & Recovery

### Configuration Backup
Status: Completed
**Goal**: Never lose your setup
- **Auto-backup**: Daily backup of device config and plugin settings to local file (includes API keys by default)
- **Manual export**: Download complete configuration as JSON; "Exclude API keys" checkbox (unchecked by default)
- **Import/restore**: Use Settings ‚Ä∫ Backup & Restore to upload configuration and restore settings
- **Plugin data backup**: Backup custom plugin configurations and API keys
- **Backup & Restore settings**: Dedicated section in Settings with "Backup" and "Restore" subsections
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours | **Risk**: Low

### Simple Disaster Recovery
**Goal**: Easy recovery from issues
- **Settings reset**: Reset to defaults without losing plugins
- **Plugin isolation**: Disable problematic plugins without system restart
- **Log preservation**: Keep error logs for troubleshooting
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Risk**: Low

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience & Tools

### Development Workflow
Status: Partially Completed (validator, hot reload/dev UX in place)
**Goal**: Easier development and debugging
- **Live reload**: Auto-refresh browser when templates/CSS change
- **Debug mode**: Detailed error messages and request logging
- **Plugin validation**: Check plugin config before saving
- **Template linting**: Basic HTML/CSS validation
- **Effort**: 4-5 hours | **Risk**: Low

### Documentation & Testing
**Goal**: Better maintainability
- **Inline documentation**: Comment existing complex functions
- **Plugin examples**: Document plugin configuration patterns
- **Basic tests**: Unit tests for core functionality
- **Manual testing checklist**: Standardized testing procedures
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours | **Risk**: Low

---

## üìä Light Monitoring (Built-in)

### Simple System Health
Status: Partially Completed (logs viewer & filters shipped; dashboard metrics TODO)
**Goal**: Know when things aren't working
- **Plugin status dashboard**: Visual health check for all plugins
- **Error logging**: Centralized error collection and display
- **Resource usage**: Basic memory/disk usage display
- **Update history**: Simple log of successful/failed updates
- **Request duration stats**: p50/p95 timing for recent requests (excluding display update)
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours | **Risk**: Low

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Do

**Avoid these common pitfalls:**
- Don't rewrite existing working functionality
- Don't add authentication/user management complexity
- Don't change core plugin architecture
- Don't add external dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Don't implement features that require database changes
- Don't break existing plugin configurations
